This progream reads in a Gregorian calendar year containing at least 4 digits (leading zeroes required) and will return a true/false for whether that year is a leap year (containing 366 days). Written for the Learning Bash Scripting course. First written 2022-06-XX.

The rules of a leap year, for context:
- If a year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year (2020, 2024).
- If a year occurs at the turn of a century (i.e., is divisible by 100), it is not a leap year, despite being divisible by 4 (1800, 1900).
- The exception to this is that if the year is divisible by 400, it then becomes a leap year again (2000, 2400).
